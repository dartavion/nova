# Project Governance

## Roles
- **Maintainers**: Approve specs, merge PRs, cut releases.
- **Editors**: Curate docs, ensure consistency, manage roadmap.
- **Contributors**: Propose changes via Issues/PRs.

## Decision process
- Day-to-day: lazy consensus in Issues/PRs.
- Specs at v0.x: maintainers quorum (>=2) required.
- Breaking changes: open RFC (2 weeks discussion) → vote → tag.

## Releases
- Semantic-ish versioning for docs/specs:
    - v0.x.y: unstable, may change.
    - v1.0.0: community standard.
- Each release is signed and changelogged.

## Steering
- Annual rotation of at least one maintainer seat.
- Conflicts of interest must be declared on relevant issues/PRs.

## Transparency
- All decisions recorded in Issues or Discussions and linked in CHANGELOG.
