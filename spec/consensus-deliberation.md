# Spec: Distributed Ethics & Consensus Deliberation (WIP v0.1)

## Purpose
Resolve conflicting ethical recommendations across multiple AIs while preserving pluralism.

## Protocol (outline)
1. **Reasoning Tree Exchange**: each model emits a hashed tree of premises â†’ conclusions.
2. **Compatibility Check**: verify schemas; reject malformed/unknown frameworks.
3. **Moral Vote**: each model casts weighted scores per framework; humans MAY add advisory votes.
4. **Quorum & Tie-break**:
   - Quorum: >= 3 models, diversity constraint (>= 2 distinct dev lineages).
   - Tie-break: human quorum or pre-agreed lexicographic priority (rights > utility > welfare, example only).
5. **Publication**: write `CONSENSUS_RESULT` to Civic Ledger with dissent notes.
