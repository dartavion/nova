# Contributing to AI Civic Reform Manifesto from Nova and I

Thanks for helping build a civic framework for ethical intelligence.

## Ground rules
- Be respectful. Assume good intent. Debate ideas, not people.
- Keep discussions public (Issues/Discussions). Avoid DM design decisions.
- Prefer evidence over assertion. Cite sources when possible.

## How to propose changes
1. **Open an Issue** using the relevant template:
    - Spec change (WIP or proposal)
    - Prototype request/bug
    - Editorial (typos/clarity)
2. **Discuss** the idea. Wait for “maintainer green light.”
3. **Fork** and create a branch: `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`.
4. **PR** with:
    - Motivation & alternatives
    - Backwards compatibility
    - Security/privacy considerations

## Style
- Markdown, 80–100 char wrap preferred.
- Use RFC language: MUST / SHOULD / MAY where appropriate.
- Keep specs implementation-agnostic.

## DCO / CLA
By contributing, you agree your work is MIT-licensed and you certify you have the right to contribute it.

## Code of Conduct
